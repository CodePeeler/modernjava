# modernjava

This is a toy project set up demonstrate some of the key difference between the old school Java and the newer more functional java from version 8 onwards.
In particular the Stream API and functional interfaces are touch on. The project can be built with maven and uses Spring to provides a REST API where by you 
may trigger various different sorting and filtering behaviour on a very basic toy data set of apples.
